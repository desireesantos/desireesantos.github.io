The world has become a true digital platform. Everything is reduced to lower bit: music, video, voice, images.
Binary Digit (Bit) is the smallest unit of information in this digital world.

There are technologies with high technological impact, with real society levers. Change our lives. As an example, microelectronics, nanotechnology, among others. Have you ever stopped to wonder what were the microelectronic technological breakthroughs?
Now follows a study that start and would like to share with you.

Marks the birth of microelectronics
------------------------------------


The valve opened the way for electronics in the early 20th century, only to speak well remember the photos of the ENIAC. 1,800 valves and weighing 27 tolenadas!
Almost 50 then came transistors, 200 times smaller than the valve, allowing the process of miniturização electronics.



    year | Event
 ------- | -----------
* 1947 * | Invention of the silicon transistor component 200 less than valve
* 1959 * | Integrated circuit (IC) Associating ... diodes and other components miniaturiazlidados
* 1971 * | Robert Noyce Intel founders creates 4004, first microcomputer in a single chip with central processing unit (CPU)

Events that made possible the birth of the personal computer. Intel launched the famous chips in the PC world: 8008, 8080, 8026, 286, 386, 486, Pentium 1, ...
The first chips possessed only * * tens of transistors in 2010 already posuiam of hundreds of millions of transistors.

This revolution of the chip and microprocessor was the advent of DVD, CT scan, phone, ...
A discovery that caused a revolution not only technological, but economic and industrial, social and cultural. We're talking there about 1970 year Brazil won the World Cup for the third, ie a not so distant past!

Seconds researchers, the number of components inside the chip has been doubling every 18 months, as has been happening about 45 years, the chips will reach the limits of molecular dimensions, depleting the miniaturialização process.
The prediction was made by Gordon Moore in the 1960s - called Moore's Law.
